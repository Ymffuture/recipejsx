    "Now add the liquid ingredients to the dry ones and mix just until the dry ingredients are barely incorporated. Don't mix too longâ€”10 to 15 seconds at the most! The batter will be visibly lumpy, and you may see pockets of dry flour, but that's okay. Overmixing the batter will cause your muffins to be rubbery.",
    "Let the batter rest for 10 to 15 minutes, to allow the glutens in the flour to relax, and some of those pockets of dry flour to dissolve.",
    "Gently pour the batter into the prepared muffin pan and bake immediately.",

    "Serve and enjoy."
